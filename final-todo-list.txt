Vornoi-Ice Todo:

1. look into making the ice layer interactable by pressing "F" to mark a spot
for a Vornoi seed (perhaps leaving some sort of marking on the ice)
	1a. find out how to convert global position -> local coordinates on the ice rink cube

2. Figure out how to reconstruct a Vornoi diagram given a list of seeds (positions on the ice cube)
	2a. Try just setting pixels on the ice cube object throughout the constant y position, and changing the pixel color
	2b disable marking ice after reconstruction complete

3. figure out how to build the Vornoi diagram in real-time.
	3a. stretch goal: add ability to remove markers with "R"

4. Figure out how to reset map

5. Replace placeholder assets with Blender-made assets. 

6. Stretch goal: add more levels

7. Figure out how to do it with textures...?
