Voronoitic is a first-person game in which one can plant Voronoi seeds on an ice rink and then visualize a Voronoi Diagram (VD).
After construction, the player can see the Voronoi Diagram from an overhead view or clear the current diagram and make a new one.
All online demos of VDs that I've seen don't allow users to walk on them so I thought I'd do it.
This version uses an outside Fortune's algorithm implementation while I repair mine.

Online WebGL Version Here:

If the WebGL version is laggy, you can copy and paste the windows-build folder and launch the "Voronoitic.exe" inside the folder without needing Unity installed.
The Linux build is untested at the moment but it should just be a matter of copying the linux-build folder and launching the relevant x86_64 file.

Please report any issues to me as I plan on expanding this project.
